----------------------------------- Purpose ------------------------------------
The project is to show our abilities we have learned throughout the semester to 
write secure software by leaving us with an open-ended project which consists of
creating an Email Server which will require users to create a username and
password to login onto the server to use the features including, but not
exclusively, seeing other registered users, sending, and receiving messages from
other registered users. 
------------------------------------- How --------------------------------------
The project will be contructed in a few parts, all working together to create a
good user experience. To do this we will have a server, which will do most of
the heavy lifting for encrypting messages and hosting a platform in which users
will interact with. The second component will be the users interface, which will
connect to the server and have a simple UI to choose actions which they will
preform. Our goal is to support simplified Emailing, but will want to push for
more features as we see fit, such as real time updating.
